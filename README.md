# My-portfolio

I am Shanmugapriya. With a strong foundation in Business Analytics, backed by an MSc in Business Analytics from the UK. I specialize in data management, predictive modelling, data visualization and machine learning. With proficiency in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI and Excel, I transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive decision-making.

In this portfolio, you will find projects demonstrating my expertise in data preprocessing, statistical modelling and visualization techniques. Some key highlights include my Sports Center Attendance Prediction project, where I applied machine learning techniques to identify key factors influencing user attendance and my Marketing Analytics project, which provided actionable insights for Hepatitis Diagnosis.

I am highly analytical and passionate about solving real-world business challenges through data-driven strategies. I enjoy working in collaborative environments, where I can leverage my skills to optimize processes and enhance decision-making.

# Applied Analytics Project

## Winter Rock Operations Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes Winter Rock's sales trends, forecasting, distribution optimization, and new product launch strategies using advanced data analytics techniques. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to optimize operations for the next winter season.

üìä Key Topics Covered

- Sales Trends Analysis:

1.Investigated time-series data to identify seasonal patterns.
2. Used 12-month centered moving average (CMA-12) for trend smoothing.

- Sales Forecasting:

1. Applied Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) for sales prediction.
2. Evaluated error metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- Distribution Plan Optimization:

1. Used Linear Programming (LP) to minimize distribution costs.
2.  Optimized shipments from Manchester & London distribution centers.

- New Product Demand Planning:

1. Developed a Decision Tree Model to compare supplier options.
2. Conducted Monte Carlo Simulation to assess profitability.

## üìà Key Findings & Recommendations

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Trends & Seasonality

‚úî Sales peak in October - December, aligning with the winter sports season.

‚úî CMA-12 analysis confirms a strong upward trend in sales.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Forecasting & Accuracy

‚úî SES model predicts stable sales but struggles with seasonality.

‚úî Optimal alpha value (Œ± = 0.2) ensures balance between bias and accuracy.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Distribution Plan

‚úî The Manchester center ships 2000 units, London handles 2200 units.

‚úî This minimizes total shipping costs to ¬£99,615.

4Ô∏è‚É£ New Product Supplier Decision

‚úî Decision Tree & Monte Carlo Simulation favor the USA supplier.

‚úî Expected profit = ¬£35,000, higher than the European supplier.

‚úî Winter Rock should consider risk mitigation strategies before finalizing.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how data analytics can drive operational efficiency. The optimized distribution plan and supplier selection provide a roadmap for Winter Rock to reduce costs and increase profitability.
