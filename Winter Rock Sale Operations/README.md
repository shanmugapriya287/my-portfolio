Overview

This project analyzes Winter Rock's sales trends, forecasting, distribution optimization, and new product launch strategies using advanced data analytics techniques. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to optimize operations for the next winter season.

📊 Key Topics Covered

Sales Trends Analysis:

Investigated time-series data to identify seasonal patterns.
Used 12-month centered moving average (CMA-12) for trend smoothing.
Sales Forecasting:

Applied Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) for sales prediction.
Evaluated error metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Distribution Plan Optimization:

Used Linear Programming (LP) to minimize distribution costs.
Optimized shipments from Manchester & London distribution centers.
New Product Demand Planning:

Developed a Decision Tree Model to compare supplier options.
Conducted Monte Carlo Simulation to assess profitability.

📈 Key Findings & Recommendations

1️⃣ Sales Trends & Seasonality

✔ Sales peak in October - December, aligning with the winter sports season.
✔ CMA-12 analysis confirms a strong upward trend in sales.

2️⃣ Forecasting & Accuracy

✔ SES model predicts stable sales but struggles with seasonality.
✔ Optimal alpha value (α = 0.2) ensures balance between bias and accuracy.

3️⃣ Optimized Distribution Plan

✔ The Manchester center ships 2000 units, London handles 2200 units.
✔ This minimizes total shipping costs to £99,615.

4️⃣ New Product Supplier Decision

✔ Decision Tree & Monte Carlo Simulation favor the USA supplier.
✔ Expected profit = £35,000, higher than the European supplier.
✔ Winter Rock should consider risk mitigation strategies before finalizing.
