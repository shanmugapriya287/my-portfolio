Overview

This project analyzes Winter Rock's sales trends, forecasting, distribution optimization, and new product launch strategies using advanced data analytics techniques. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to optimize operations for the next winter season.

üìä Key Topics Covered

1. Sales Trends Analysis:

- Investigated time-series data to identify seasonal patterns.
- Used 12-month centered moving average (CMA-12) for trend smoothing.

2. Sales Forecasting:

- Applied Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) for sales prediction.
- Evaluated error metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

3. Distribution Plan Optimization:

- Used Linear Programming (LP) to minimize distribution costs.
- Optimized shipments from Manchester & London distribution centers.

4. New Product Demand Planning:

- Developed a Decision Tree Model to compare supplier options.
0- Conducted Monte Carlo Simulation to assess profitability.

üìà Key Findings & Recommendations

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Trends & Seasonality

‚úî Sales peak in October - December, aligning with the winter sports season.

‚úî CMA-12 analysis confirms a strong upward trend in sales.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Forecasting & Accuracy

‚úî SES model predicts stable sales but struggles with seasonality.

‚úî Optimal alpha value (Œ± = 0.2) ensures balance between bias and accuracy.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Distribution Plan

‚úî The Manchester center ships 2000 units, London handles 2200 units.

‚úî This minimizes total shipping costs to ¬£99,615.

4Ô∏è‚É£ New Product Supplier Decision

‚úî Decision Tree & Monte Carlo Simulation favor the USA supplier.

‚úî Expected profit = ¬£35,000, higher than the European supplier.

‚úî Winter Rock should consider risk mitigation strategies before finalizing.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can drive operational efficiency. The optimized distribution plan and supplier selection provide a roadmap for Winter Rock to reduce costs and increase profitability.
